<p> Pulau Pangkor is an island off the coast of Perak in north-west peninsular Malaysia, reached by ferry either from the old jetty or from Marina Island jetty [1] both located in Lumut (a small coastal town that links to Ipoh through Sitiawan). It has a land area of only 8 square kilometers, and a population of approximately 25,000 islanders. It is promoted as a low-key tourist destination by the Malaysian government, but fishing, seafood and other fishing-related products remain major industries.  </p>

<p> Srimongol is accessible by rail or by public bus. If arriving via train it is best to call ahead and ask Shamsul to arrange your transport to his eco-cottages if you haven’t been to Srimongol before. For those familiar with the location of the Tea Resort, you need to continue onwards past the tea resort gate and turn right after passing the upcoming Grand Sultan Resort, then proceed for another few hundred meters until you reach a small village, and you see a concrete building with a small terrace out front, covered by a roof. </p>

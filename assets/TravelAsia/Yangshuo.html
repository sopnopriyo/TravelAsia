<p> Yangshuo is a popular tourist county and city near Guilin, Guangxi. The town is surrounded by karst mountains, winding rivers and beautiful scenery. It serves as a fantastic base camp for further exploration.


Yangshuo is popular among tourists for its karst peaks, rivers, caves, and temples as well as its laid back cafes and bars. As such, the city is visited by a large number of Chinese tourists and foreigners alike, and has a relatively big ex-pats community.

Yangshuo is now a relatively large tourist town, different from most typical Chinese towns. </p>

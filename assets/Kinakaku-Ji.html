<p> Kinkaku-ji  is a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan. The garden complex is an excellent example of Muromachi period garden design. The Muromachi period is considered to be a classical age of Japanese garden design.[4] The correlation between buildings and its settings were greatly emphasized during this period.[4] It was a way to integrate the structure within the landscape in an artistic way. The garden designs were characterized by a reduction in scale, a more central purpose, and a distinct setting.[5] A minimalistic approach was brought to the garden design, by recreating larger landscapes in a smaller scale around a structure.[5] </p>
